<p>one block east and one block south there is a park. there is no grass. the
surfaces are smooth. one soccer field and three basketball courts, submerged in
the middle of a sea of tall buildings. i'm sitting on the concrete stands.
fourth section down, sixth row up, seventh seat in. three fans affixed to
trestles above are blowing down. in jeans, boots, and a short-sleeved button
down, i'm comfortable, even cool. the moving air is refreshing, a temporary
respite from the suffocating, all-encompassing humidity that has been a faithful
partner my entire stay. there’s a new sound and when i look up i see it’s
raining. i don’t have an umbrella but i won’t need one. showers move through
fast and frequent. the rain is refreshing. it’s cooler now, and i'm content.</p>
